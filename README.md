# Phone Price Comparison User Manual

The intended purpose of our application is to allow users to look up and compare the prices of different smartphones. Users will be able to create an account with a username and password.  A user will be able to search up any phone they are interested in and it will display the different prices from different retailers. Users will also be able to see the rating point of a phone.

# Setup and Installation
Users can clone the repo to their desktop or download the zip folder. Using the terminal, access the repo folder and go to the "Back end" folder. Here, run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies. Then run 'npm start' to start the backend web service. With another terminal, cd back to the root folder and access the "Front end" folder. Then go to the "src" folder. Here, run 'npm install' for all the dependencies. Then run 'npm start' to start up the website. The database is already being hosted on a cloud service provider, so users do not need to host it themselves. The Database Dump is located in the root directory of this repo.

# Walkthrough & Navigation
  Once setup is complete, the user can run the application and view the landing screen.
